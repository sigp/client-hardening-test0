# Claude Guidelines

This repository will be primarily technical prose, it is unlikely to have a large code component.

When writing, please use a professional, technical tone. Avoid heavy use of emojis. Prefer precise and succinct content.

Refer to the README.md in the root of the repo for details on project objectives, directory structure and security guidelines.

Always consider the security guidelines when performing any task.

Whenever a task alters the structure of the repository, consider updating the README.md too.

Prefer keeping the root README.md a concise "front-page" for the project. Place detailed documentation in the `docs/` directory and then link to it in the README.md.

When adding any documentation, add it to the `docs/` directory. Respect the naming convention for files (lowercase with hyphens).
