# Ethereum Client Hardening

This repository contains simulations and analyses of adverse network conditions and attack scenarios targeting Ethereum clients. The goal is to systematically test, document, and improve the resilience of Ethereum client implementations against various forms of network instability and malicious activity.

## Purpose

The Ethereum network's security and stability depend on the robustness of client implementations. By simulating challenging network conditions and attack vectors, we aim to:

- Identify vulnerabilities and edge cases in client behavior
- Document recovery mechanisms and failure modes
- Develop and validate mitigation strategies
- Strengthen the overall resilience of the Ethereum ecosystem

This effort focuses specifically on client implementation resilience and purposely avoids duplicating existing efforts by tracking or documenting protocol-level vulnerabilities or improvements (see [ethereum/consensus-specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs)).

## Repository Structure

Each simulation is organized into the following structure:

```
simulations/
├── simulation-name/
│   ├── definition.md           # Simulation specification
│   ├── runs/                   # Individual test executions
│   │   ├── run-001/
│   │   │   ├── description.md  # Detailed run parameters
│   │   │   ├── logs/          # Client logs and data
│   │   │   └── issues.md      # Discovered issues and resolutions
│   │   └── run-002/
│   │       └── ...
│   └── mitigations/           # (Future) Implemented hardening measures
│       └── ...
```

### Simulation Components

#### Definition (`definition.md`)
Each simulation begins with a clear specification that includes:
- Objective and scope of the simulation
- High-level description of the adverse condition or attack
- Expected client behaviors and failure modes
- Success criteria and measurement approach

#### Runs (`runs/`)
Individual executions of a simulation, each containing:
- **Description** (`description.md`): Specific parameters including client distribution, network topology, timing, and environmental conditions
- **Logs** (`logs/`): Raw client outputs, network captures, and monitoring data
- **Issues** (`issues.md`): Documented problems discovered during the run, including:
  - Issue descriptions and impact assessment
  - Root cause analysis
  - Resolution steps taken
  - Client-specific behaviors observed

#### Mitigations (`mitigations/`)
*Future component* - Documented hardening measures developed in response to simulation findings:
- Code changes and configuration updates
- Operational procedures and monitoring improvements
- Network-level defenses and recovery mechanisms

## Getting Started

1. Browse existing simulations in the `simulations/` directory
2. Review simulation definitions to understand the test scenarios
3. Examine run results to see real-world client behavior under stress
4. Contribute new simulations or run variations of existing ones

## Contributing

When adding new simulations:
- Ensure the simulation specification is detailed enough for reproducibility
- Document all parameters and environmental conditions
- Provide clear analysis of results and findings
- Follow the established directory structure
