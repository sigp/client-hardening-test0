# Non-finality

## Objective

This simulation examines how different Ethereum client implementations handle periods of non-finality, where the beacon chain is unable to finalize blocks for extended periods due to network conditions or validator participation issues.

## Scope

This simulation examines how different Ethereum client implementations handle:
- Extended periods without finalization
- Chain reorganizations during non-finality
- Recovery mechanisms when finality resumes
