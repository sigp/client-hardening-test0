# Non-finality

## Objective

This simulation tests how Ethereum client implementations handle non-finality scenarios where the beacon chain fails to reach consensus finality for extended periods.

## Scope

This simulation examines how different Ethereum client implementations handle:
- Extended periods without finalization
- Fork choice rule behavior during non-finality
- Client performance degradation under non-finality conditions
