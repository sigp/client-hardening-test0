# Example-2

## Objective

This simulation provides a second example case for testing Ethereum client implementations under various network conditions and scenarios.

## Scope

This simulation examines how different Ethereum client implementations handle:
- Network partition recovery
- Block propagation delays
- Validator slashing conditions
