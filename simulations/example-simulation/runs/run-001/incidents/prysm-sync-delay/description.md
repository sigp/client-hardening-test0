# Prysm Node Extended Sync Time and Side-Chain Block Production

## Issue Summary

Prysm node `prysm-validator-01` experienced significantly delayed synchronization, taking approximately 1 hour to fully sync with the canonical chain. During this period, the node produced several blocks on a side-chain, contributing to temporary network instability.

## Timeline

- **15:00:00** - Network restart initiated
- **15:03:45** - Prysm node started successfully
- **15:08:12** - Node began initial sync process
- **15:15:30** - First side-chain block produced (slot 14268)
- **15:22:15** - Additional side-chain blocks produced (slots 14275, 14280)
- **15:45:22** - Sync process still ongoing, at 75% completion
- **16:02:18** - Finally achieved full synchronization
- **16:03:45** - Node switched to canonical chain and began proper block production

## Root Cause Analysis

The extended sync time appears to be caused by the node's conservative approach to chain validation after extended downtime. The node performed extensive verification of each block and state transition, leading to slower but more thorough synchronization.

### Contributing Factors
1. **Conservative Sync Strategy:** Full verification of all missed blocks and state transitions
2. **Limited Peer Bandwidth:** Available peers were also still synchronizing, reducing data availability
3. **State Reconstruction:** Node rebuilt validator state from scratch rather than using cached data
4. **Resource Constraints:** High CPU usage during state reconstruction limited sync speed

## Impact Assessment

- **Duration:** ~62 minutes of extended sync time
- **Side-Chain Blocks:** 3 blocks produced on incorrect chain
- **Validators Affected:** 6 validators produced attestations on side-chain
- **Network Impact:** Minor - caused temporary reduction in finality speed
- **Data Integrity:** No corruption - node maintained complete audit trail

## Side-Chain Block Details

The node produced blocks on a minority fork while still synchronizing:
- **Block 14268:** Hash 0x3f4e5d6c..., 12 attestations
- **Block 14275:** Hash 0x7a8b9c0d..., 8 attestations  
- **Block 14280:** Hash 0xb1c2d3e4..., 15 attestations

These blocks were eventually orphaned when the node completed synchronization.

## Resolution

The issue resolved naturally once the node completed its comprehensive sync process. No manual intervention was required.

## Client-Specific Behavior

This conservative sync approach was unique to Prysm in this test. Other clients used cached state data to achieve faster synchronization at the cost of some verification thoroughness.

## Recommendations

1. **Sync Strategy Configuration:** Consider adding fast-sync options for post-outage scenarios
2. **Progress Monitoring:** Improve sync progress reporting and estimated completion times
3. **Resource Allocation:** Investigate optimal CPU/memory allocation during sync process
4. **Chain Selection:** Review fork choice algorithm to prevent block production during uncertain sync states
