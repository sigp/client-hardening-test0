# Example Simulation: Network Shutdown and Recovery

## Objective

Test Ethereum client behavior and recovery mechanisms when the entire network experiences a complete shutdown followed by a coordinated restart.

## Scope

This simulation examines how different Ethereum client implementations handle:
- Complete network isolation and downtime
- Chain reorganization upon network restart
- Peer discovery and synchronization after extended outage
- Block production resumption and finality recovery

## Simulation Description

### Network Shutdown Phase
All participating nodes in the test network are simultaneously shut down, simulating a catastrophic network-wide failure. This creates a scenario where:
- No blocks are produced for the duration of the outage
- All peer connections are severed
- Client state is preserved but becomes stale

### Recovery Phase
After a predetermined duration (1 hour), all nodes are restarted simultaneously. This tests:
- Client startup behavior after extended downtime
- Peer discovery and network reformation
- Chain tip identification and synchronization
- Block production resumption and validator coordination

## Expected Client Behaviors

### During Shutdown
- Clients should gracefully handle loss of all peers
- State should be preserved and uncorrupted
- Clients should not panic or corrupt databases

### During Recovery
- Clients should successfully restart and initialize
- Peer discovery should establish network connectivity
- Clients should identify the correct chain tip
- Block production should resume normally
- Network should achieve finality within expected timeframes

## Success Criteria

- All clients restart successfully without manual intervention
- Network connectivity is re-established within 10 minutes
- Block production resumes within 15 minutes
- Network achieves finality within 30 minutes
- No data corruption or state inconsistencies occur

## Measurement Approach

- Monitor client logs for errors and restart behavior
- Track peer connection establishment times
- Measure time to first block production
- Monitor finality progression
- Verify chain consistency across all nodes
